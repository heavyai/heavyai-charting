/**
 * The dc.js filters are functions which are passed into crossfilter to chose which records will be
 * accumulated to produce values for the charts.  In the crossfilter model, any filters applied on one
 * dimension will affect all the other dimensions but not that one.  dc always applies a filter
 * function to the dimension; the function combines multiple filters and if any of them accept a
 * record, it is filtered in.
 *
 * These filter constructors are used as appropriate by the various charts to implement brushing.  We
 * mention below which chart uses which filter.  In some cases, many instances of a filter will be added.
 *
 * Each of the dc.js filters is an object with the following properties:
 * * `isFiltered` - a function that returns true if a value is within the filter
 * * `filterType` - a string identifying the filter, here the name of the constructor
 *
 * Currently these filter objects are also arrays, but this is not a requirement. Custom filters
 * can be used as long as they have the properties above.

 * The RangedTwoDimensionalFilter allows filtering all values which fit within a rectangular

 * `x1 <= x2` and `y1 <- y2`. It then returns a filter which accepts any points which are in the
 * rectangular range including the lower values but excluding the higher values.
