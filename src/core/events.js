 * This function triggers a throttled event function with a specified delay (in milli-seconds).  Events
 * that are triggered repetitively due to user interaction such brush dragging might flood the library
 * and invoke more renders than can be executed in time. Using this function to wrap your event
 * function allows the library to smooth out the rendering by throttling events and only responding to
 * the most recent event.
 * @name events.trigger
 * @memberof dc
 * @example
 * chart.on('renderlet', function(chart) {
 *     // smooth the rendering through event throttling
 *     dc.events.trigger(function(){
 *         // focus some other chart to the range selected by user on this chart
 *         someOtherChart.focus(chart.filter());
 *     });
