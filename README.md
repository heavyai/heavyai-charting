# Synopsis

MapD-Charting is a superfast charting library that works natively with [crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) that is based off [dc.js](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js).  It is designed to work with MapD-Connector and MapD-Crossfilter to create charts instantly with our MapD-Core SQL Database.  Please see [examples](#examples) for further understanding to quickly create interactive charts.

Our [Tweetmap Demo](https://www.mapd.com/demos/tweetmap/) was made only using MapD-Charting.

# Documentation

# Testing

New components in MapD-Charting should be unit-tested and linted.  All tests will be in the same folder as the new component.

```
+-- src
|   +-- /mixins/new-mixin-component.js
|   +-- /mixins/new-mixin-component.unit.spec.js
```

The linter and all tests run on
```bash
yarn run test
```

To check only unit-tests run:
```bash
yarn run test:unit
```

### Linting

Please lint all your code in `mapd-charting/`. The lint config file can be found in `.eslintrc.json`.  For new components, please fix all lint warnings and errors.
